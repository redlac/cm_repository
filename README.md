## Work/Project Examples
1. Mini-Message-Board: Last summer I decided to start learning Node.js and express. I created a small message board (alone) that allows anyone to post their name and a message. The site is hosted on Heroku and MySQL is used to store the message board data.

2. Asylum-Seekers website: I am currently involved in the development of a web application that will be used by asylum seekers going to the U.S. This is the final project for my school program which I along with four others started in January and will finish in April. My role is split between doing back-end work with Java technologies and front-end development with the React framework. I created the initial back-end structure and initiated development of the REST API. Currently I am working on the Content Management system on the front-end, and making sure it interfaces well with the back end through the REST API. We are using the Spring Boot Java framework on the back end, along with MySQL and Hibernate ORM. On the front end we are using the React JavaScript framework along with the OpenLayers map API to display an interactive map. We are using a REST API in order to interface between the back end and front end of the system. The project consists of an interactive map that tells the stories of the journeys that asylum seekers take, in an engaging way, along with a content management system that allows the users to add new multimedia content to the site. There is also an admin interface for managing users, and we are currently working on a reporting and back up system for website data.

3. Home Inventory system: My final solo project for a web application development course that I created in December was a home inventory system. This application was made to help people keep track of items in their houses. You can add new items to the system under a certain category, like kitchen or bathroom, and also save the value of those items in dollars. There is also functionality for adding new item categories, and an admin interface for managing users and generating Excel reports about users and the items that they have. This project used Java Servlets, Tomcat web server, and MySQL for the back-end. On the front-end I used the Bulma CSS framework to create a consistent user interface along with Java JSPs.

## Inspiration

1. I recently found this button demo: https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/bKens. It shows how to make squishy toggle buttons. I think it's really cool because it looks very realistic, and it's amazing because it was created with HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript. I can imagine making an entire user interface that looks like this.

2. Scaling to 100k Users (Blog post): https://alexpareto.com/scalability/systems/2020/02/03/scaling-100k.html
This blog post is about the thought process behind scaling a web application from 10's to 100000's of users. I thought that the part about scaling to 1000 or more users was the most interesting because it talks about load balancers and CDNs, which I haven't had the opportunity to see on a real project yet. Someday I'd like to work on a project that uses these technologies. 

3. I have recently become interested in the Rust programming language and static site generators, and so I found a project that uses both: https://github.com/getzola/zola. It's called Zola and it makes it easy to get a basic static website up and running quickly. I like that it's open source, so that I could contribute new features in the future if I want. I recently started a blog on using Zola that is hosted on Netlify, just to try it out. Here is a link to the blog: https://happy-cori-96ef5a.netlify.com/.

## Focus

I would love to work on a real project for a real client, and be involved in as much of the full project lifecycle as possible. If I could build anything, it would be an application that could support 100s or 1000s of users, something with a lot of interactivity on the front-end that is supported by a database of some kind. My favourite area to work on is back-end/server side development, but I like the front-end too! The best part is seeing all of the pieces of a project come together to make something cool.
